    <h2>Tender Management & Bid Support</h2>

    <p>
      Tender opportunities represent significant revenue potential,
      but many organizations struggle due to weak compliance,
      poor documentation, and limited internal capacity.
      Pathedge Investment Limited provides end-to-end tender
      management and bid support services that improve participation,
      submission quality, and tender win rates.
