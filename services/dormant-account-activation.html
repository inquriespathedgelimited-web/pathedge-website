    <h2>Dormant Account Activation</h2>

    <p>
      Most dormant customers are not lost — they simply need attention,
      solutions, and improved convenience.
      Pathedge Investment Limited specializes in re-engaging inactive
      customers through structured, empathetic, and results-driven engagement.
    </p>

    <h3>The Challenge</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Inactive customer accounts and declining recurring revenue</li>
      <li>Poor customer follow-up and low engagement levels</li>
      <li>Unresolved onboarding, service, or communication issues</li>
      <li>High cost of acquiring new customers to replace existing ones</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Our Solution</h3>
    <p>
      Pathedge applies a human-centered activation model focused on
      rebuilding trust, resolving pain points, and restoring value
      through professional, structured conversations.
    </p>

    <h3>Our Activation Process</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Account Segmentation:</strong> Identify why accounts became inactive and categorize them by value and recovery potential</li>
      <li><strong>Human-Centered Conversations:</strong> Empathetic engagement conducted by trained professionals</li>
      <li><strong>Pain-Point Resolution:</strong> Address service delays, onboarding challenges, or communication gaps</li>
      <li><strong>Reactivation Pathways:</strong> Digital onboarding, service reviews, convenience options, or personalized support</li>
      <li><strong>Activity Monitoring:</strong> Track customer behaviour over a 30–90 day period to ensure sustained usage</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Outcome</h3>
