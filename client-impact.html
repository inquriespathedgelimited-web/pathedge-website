    <p>
      Pathedge Investment Limited works closely with organisations across Zambia
      to deliver measurable commercial outcomes through disciplined business development execution,
      sales performance improvement, and tender management support.
    </p>

    <h2>Technology Hardware Supply</h2>
    <p>
      A technology hardware supplier faced challenges in building a consistent and qualified B2B sales pipeline.
      Pathedge implemented structured lead generation, opportunity qualification, and sales execution support.
      As a result, the client achieved significant growth in active pipeline value, customer base expansion,
      and revenue performance.
    </p>

    <h2>Automotive & Heavy Machinery Windscreens</h2>
    <p>
      Pathedge supported a company specialising in the supply and installation of windscreens for mining,
      agricultural equipment, heavy-duty trucks, and general vehicles.
      Our engagement focused on strengthening B2B engagement, improving sales execution,
      and positioning the company for institutional and corporate opportunities.
    </p>

    <h2>General Supply & Tender Management</h2>
    <p>
      We provided end-to-end tender management and bid support services to a general supply company,
      enabling improved compliance, documentation quality, and submission discipline.
      The client successfully secured multiple tenders across both government and private sector institutions.
    </p>

    <h2>Auto Spares & Parts Sales</h2>
    <p>
      Pathedge was tasked with B2B lead generation and sales execution support for an auto spares business.
      Through targeted prospecting and pipeline management,
      the company recorded strong growth in qualified opportunities,
      improved conversion rates, and increased sales volumes.
