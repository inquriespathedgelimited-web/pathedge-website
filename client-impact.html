    <p>
      Pathedge Investment Limited partners with organisations across
      different industries to support structured business development execution.
      Our engagements focus on solving real commercial challenges
      and delivering measurable outcomes.
    </p>

    <h2>Technology Hardware Supply Company</h2>
    <p><strong>The Challenge</strong></p>
    <p>
      The client operated in the technology hardware supply space
      and faced challenges building a consistent pipeline of qualified B2B clients.
      Sales efforts were largely reactive, with limited visibility
      of decision-makers and opportunities.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Pathedge Intervention</strong></p>
    <p>
      Pathedge implemented structured B2B lead generation
      and supported sales execution.
      This included identifying target organisations,
      mapping decision-makers,
      qualifying prospects,
      and improving follow-up discipline.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Outcome</strong></p>
    <p>
      The client recorded improved pipeline visibility,
      increased qualified opportunities,
      growth in customer base,
      and improved revenue performance.
    </p>

    <h2>Windscreen Supply & Installation (Mining, Agriculture & Transport)</h2>
    <p><strong>The Challenge</strong></p>
    <p>
      The business supplied and installed windscreens
      for mining equipment, agricultural machinery,
      heavy-duty trucks, and general vehicles.
      Growth was limited by weak institutional engagement
      and inconsistent B2B outreach.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Pathedge Intervention</strong></p>
    <p>
      Pathedge supported structured B2B engagement,
      institutional outreach,
      and sales execution across mining,
      agricultural, and transport sectors.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Outcome</strong></p>
    <p>
      The client strengthened relationships with institutional customers,
      improved market visibility,
      and recorded growth in both enquiries and active opportunities.
    </p>

    <h2>General Supply Company – Tender Management</h2>
    <p><strong>The Challenge</strong></p>
    <p>
      The client operated as a general supply company
      serving government and private sector institutions.
      The business faced challenges identifying suitable tenders
      and meeting compliance and documentation requirements.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Pathedge Intervention</strong></p>
    <p>
      Pathedge provided tender identification,
      compliance support,
      documentation coordination,
      and submission management.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Outcome</strong></p>
    <p>
      The client successfully secured multiple tenders
      across both government and private sector institutions,
      strengthening revenue streams and institutional credibility.
    </p>

    <h2>Auto Spares & Parts Sales Company</h2>
    <p><strong>The Challenge</strong></p>
    <p>
      The company faced limited growth due to weak B2B lead generation
      and inconsistent sales execution.
      Opportunities were often missed due to poor follow-up.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Pathedge Intervention</strong></p>
    <p>
      Pathedge supported structured B2B lead generation
      and improved sales execution discipline,
      including opportunity tracking and follow-up.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Outcome</strong></p>
    <p>
      The company recorded significant growth
      in its ready pipeline,
      improved conversion rates,
      and increased sales performance.
    </p>

    <p>
      Across all engagements,
      Pathedge remains focused on disciplined execution,
      accountability,
      and delivering results that support long-term growth.
