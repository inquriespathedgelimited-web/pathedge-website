    <p>
      Pathedge Investment Limited has supported organisations
      across technology, construction, automotive, and general supply
      to improve commercial performance.
    </p>

    <h2>Technology Hardware Supplier</h2>
    <p>
      The client struggled with inconsistent B2B lead flow.
      Pathedge implemented structured lead generation and sales execution,
      resulting in improved pipeline quality and revenue growth.
    </p>

    <h2>Windscreen Supply & Installation</h2>
    <p>
      Serving mining, agriculture, and transport sectors,
      the client required stronger institutional engagement.
      Pathedge supported B2B outreach and execution,
      strengthening market presence and opportunity flow.
    </p>

    <h2>General Supply & Tenders</h2>
    <p>
      Pathedge provided tender management support,
      enabling the client to successfully secure both
      government and private sector tenders.
