    <h2>B2B Lead Generation</h2>
    <p>

      of qualified decision-makers.

      that identify, qualify, and engage the right prospects.

    <h2>Dormant Account Activation</h2>
    <p>
      Dormant clients represent lost revenue.
      Pathedge works with you to analyse inactive accounts,
      re-engage stakeholders, and restore commercial relationships.
    </p>

    <h2>Sales Execution & Pipeline Management</h2>
    <p>
      Strong strategies fail without disciplined execution.
      Pathedge supports opportunity tracking, follow-up,
      and conversion to ensure deals progress and close.
