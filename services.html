    <p>
      Pathedge Investment Limited provides structured, hands-on
      business development services designed to help organisations
      generate opportunities, improve execution,
      and achieve measurable commercial results.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our services are practical and execution-driven.
      We work alongside client teams to ensure opportunities
      are identified, followed through, and converted.
    </p>

    <!-- B2B LEAD GENERATION -->
    <h2>B2B Lead Generation</h2>

    <p><strong>The Challenge</strong></p>
    <p>
      Many organisations struggle to consistently reach
      the right decision-makers.
      Sales efforts are often unfocused,
      pipelines are weak, and growth becomes unpredictable.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Our Approach</strong></p>
    <p>
      Pathedge designs and executes structured B2B lead generation programmes.
      We identify target sectors and organisations,
      map decision-makers,
      qualify prospects, and support engagement.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Outcomes</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Stronger and more predictable sales pipelines</li>
      <li>Improved lead quality and relevance</li>
      <li>Better visibility of opportunities</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- DORMANT ACCOUNT ACTIVATION -->
    <h2>Dormant Account Activation</h2>

    <p><strong>The Challenge</strong></p>
    <p>
      Inactive customers and institutions represent lost revenue
      and weakened relationships.
      Many organisations lack the time or structure
      to re-engage these accounts effectively.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Our Approach</strong></p>
    <p>
      Pathedge analyses dormant accounts,
      prioritises re-engagement opportunities,
      and supports structured communication
      with key stakeholders.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Outcomes</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Reactivated customer relationships</li>
      <li>Recovered revenue opportunities</li>
      <li>Stronger long-term client retention</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- SALES EXECUTION -->
    <h2>Sales Execution & Pipeline Management</h2>

    <p><strong>The Challenge</strong></p>
    <p>
      Many deals fail not because of poor products,
      but due to weak follow-up,
      inconsistent execution,
      and lack of accountability.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Our Approach</strong></p>
    <p>
      Pathedge supports disciplined sales execution
      by strengthening opportunity tracking,
      follow-up processes,
      and pipeline management.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Outcomes</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Improved conversion rates</li>
      <li>Reduced deal stagnation</li>
      <li>Clearer sales accountability</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- TENDER MANAGEMENT -->
    <h2>Tender Management & Bid Support</h2>

    <p><strong>The Challenge</strong></p>
    <p>
      Tender opportunities are often missed
      or lost due to poor compliance,
      weak documentation,
      or lack of internal capacity.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Our Approach</strong></p>
    <p>
      Pathedge provides end-to-end tender support,
      including opportunity identification,
      compliance checks,
      documentation coordination,
      and submission management.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Outcomes</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Improved tender participation</li>
      <li>Higher quality and compliant submissions</li>
      <li>Increased tender success rates</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Each engagement is tailored to the client’s objectives,
      industry, and operating environment.
      Pathedge remains focused on execution,
      accountability, and measurable results.
