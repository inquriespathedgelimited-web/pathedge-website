    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <p>
      Pathedge Investment Limited is a Zambian Business Development Company
      established to help organisations move from opportunity to execution.
      We work with businesses that require structured market engagement,
      disciplined sales execution, and professional tender management
      to achieve sustainable growth.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our strength lies in execution.
      We do not stop at strategy — we work alongside our clients
      to implement, follow through, and deliver results.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Role</h2>
    <p>
      Pathedge acts as a business development partner,
      supporting internal teams where capacity, structure,
      or market access is limited.
      We bring discipline, accountability, and commercial focus.
    </p>

    <h2>Professional Standing</h2>
    <p>
      Pathedge Investment Limited is a registered
      <strong>Corporate Member of the Zambia Institute of Marketing (ZIM)</strong>,
      reflecting our commitment to professional standards and ethical practice.
