    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <p>
      Pathedge Investment Limited is a Zambian Business Development Company
      established to support organisations that are ready to grow
      but face challenges in execution, market access, and conversion.
      We work with businesses operating across different industries
      that require structured, disciplined, and results-driven
      business development support.
    </p>

    <p>
      We understand the Zambian business environment —
      from relationship-driven sales and institutional procurement processes
      to compliance requirements and long sales cycles.
      This local understanding allows us to design practical solutions
      that work within the realities of the market.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Purpose</h2>
    <p>
      Many organisations have strong products, capable teams,
      and clear ambitions, yet struggle to convert opportunities into results.
      Common challenges include weak B2B pipelines,
      dormant customers, stalled sales opportunities,
      and low success rates in tenders.
    </p>

    <p>
      Pathedge exists to close this execution gap.
      Our role is to support organisations by bringing structure,
      discipline, accountability, and focused execution
      to their business development efforts.
    </p>

    <h2>What We Specialise In</h2>
    <p>
      Pathedge focuses on four core areas that directly impact growth
      and revenue performance:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>B2B Lead Generation</strong> – identifying, qualifying,
        and engaging decision-makers to build strong and predictable pipelines
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Dormant Account Activation</strong> – re-engaging inactive customers
        and restoring commercial relationships
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Sales Execution</strong> – strengthening follow-up,
        pipeline management, and opportunity conversion
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Tender Management</strong> – supporting tender identification,
        compliance, documentation, and submission
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Work</h2>
    <p>
      Pathedge does not operate as an advisory firm that delivers reports
      and disengages. We work as an execution partner,
      supporting our clients on the ground.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our engagements are structured, practical, and outcome-focused.
      We work closely with client teams to ensure strategies
      are implemented, opportunities are followed through,
      and performance is continuously improved.
    </p>

    <h2>Credibility & Professional Standing</h2>
    <p>
      Pathedge Investment Limited is a registered
      <strong>Corporate Member of the Zambia Institute of Marketing (ZIM)</strong>.
      This reflects our commitment to professional standards,
      ethical business practices, and disciplined marketing
      and business development execution.
    </p>

    <h2>Who We Work With</h2>
    <p>
      We work with SMEs, corporates, suppliers, contractors,
      financial institutions, NGOs, and organisations
      that operate within both the private and public sectors.
      Our clients value structure, accountability,
      and measurable commercial outcomes.
