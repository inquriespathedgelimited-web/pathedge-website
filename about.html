    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <p>
      Pathedge Investment Limited is a Zambian Business Development Company
      established to support organisations that are ready to grow
      but face challenges in execution, market access, and conversion.
      We exist to help businesses move from opportunity to results.
    </p>

    <p>
      As a locally grounded yet professionally structured firm,
      Pathedge understands the realities of doing business in Zambia —
      from institutional procurement processes and corporate sales cycles
      to relationship-driven markets and compliance requirements.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Core Focus</h2>
    <p>
      Pathedge specialises in execution-focused business development services.
      We work with organisations that require practical, hands-on support in:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>B2B Lead Generation and opportunity development</li>
      <li>Dormant Account Activation and relationship re-engagement</li>
      <li>Sales Execution and pipeline management</li>
      <li>Tender Management and bid support</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why Pathedge</h2>
    <p>
      Many organisations have capable teams and strong offerings,
      yet struggle with inconsistent pipelines, stalled opportunities,
      dormant clients, or weak tender performance.
      Pathedge was formed to close this execution gap.
    </p>

    <p>
      We do not operate as external advisors.
      We work alongside our clients as execution partners,
      bringing structure, discipline, accountability,
      and a strong commercial focus.
    </p>

    <h2>Professional Standing</h2>
    <p>
      Pathedge Investment Limited is a registered
      <strong>Corporate Member of the Zambia Institute of Marketing (ZIM)</strong>,
      reflecting our commitment to professional standards,
      ethical practice, and results-driven engagement.
