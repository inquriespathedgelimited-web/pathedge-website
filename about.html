    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <p>
      Pathedge Investment Limited is a Zambian Business Development Company
      established to bridge the gap between strategy and execution.
      We support organisations that have strong products, services,
      or opportunities but require structured market access,
      disciplined sales execution, and professional tender management
      to achieve measurable commercial results.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our role goes beyond advisory. Pathedge works as an execution partner,
      embedded alongside client teams to drive growth,
      improve performance, and unlock revenue opportunities
      across both private and public sector markets.
    </p>

    <h2>Why Pathedge Exists</h2>
    <p>
      Many organisations struggle not because of poor ideas,
      but due to weak execution, inconsistent follow-up,
      limited market intelligence, or lack of internal capacity.
      Pathedge was created to solve this execution gap by providing
      hands-on business development support that is structured,
      accountable, and results-driven.
